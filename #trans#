0:03
all right I do see uh the number of participants uh stabilizing so I think
0:09
we may want to kick us off so um this hour of webinar overshooting the
0:15
latest signs on the risks and actions needed um good evening good afternoon everyone
0:20
thanks for this big interest into into our webinar my name is loisner I'm the
0:28
lead of the EU Verizon 2020 project provide and we're going to present to
0:34
you uh today some of our latest scientific insights on precisely the topic presented to you by some of our
0:40
experts from the Consortium it's been a Foos Yuri Vogel and Benjamin Sanderson
0:46
um we will kick you off with an overview on the latest science and then we are very excited to have some Reflections uh
0:53
first from Kaiser courses um from a Greenpeace International who's
0:59
also on the scientific Advisory board or stakeholder Advisory Board of our project and uh from Philip tolkins the
1:05
head of unit climate and planetary boundaries and the research and Innovation Direct General of the European commission so by from the
1:12
European commission one of our founders of our project providing a reflection and I could hear Philip just speaking up so it seems to be all uh on board and
1:20
ready to go so with uh not much further Ado I just want to highlight why we are
1:27
doing this the project provide is specifically focusing on that question so we are looking into questions of
1:32
overshooting risks over the Paris agreement questions of reversibility climate impacts and also the dimensions
1:38
of adaptation without much further Ado I want to hand over to author speaker Louis rogel and
1:45
Yuri the florsios thank you very much Al
1:52
um also thank you very much for the opportunity to talk to you today
1:58
um in in the few uh opening Reflections that I can provide um I want to focus on our current what I
2:06
would call overconfidence in overshoot and I hope that by the end of my five
2:11
minutes it will be clear in which Dimensions I think we are currently over confident
2:18
okay let's start from the very beginning and that is uh and the city that is the
2:24
situation where we are at and that is that we currently have a very Bleak picture of where global warming is
2:31
heading and there is and and there is a relatively low chance that given the
2:37
current ndcs that are currently on the table warming will be limited below 1.5 or even 2 degrees here you can see uh
2:45
some visuals from a recent paper on the left hand side you can see
2:50
emissions Pathways of two extreme cases one where we take the pledges the ndcs
2:57
until 2013 we project them out into the future that is the higher case then on
3:02
the lower end you can see a case where we in addition to all the pledges in
3:07
2030 we also pursue all the long-term Net Zero targets so this is kind of the
3:13
range of what we are working with today um the highest end of this range leads
3:19
to warming by the end of the century well beyond two degrees
3:25
um the lower end of this um leads to warming Beyond 1.5 although it could be below 2
3:32
degrees so you you might think oh we have actually done most of the job we
3:37
are close to limiting warming well below 2 degrees and um however
3:43
not all of these long-term Net Zero targets are equally credible and in this study what we did here is we uh attached
3:51
a credibility score to the long-term Net Zero targets and without going into
3:56
detail of all the cases here if we only take those Net Zero targets that we
4:02
assign a higher confidence of being implemented and we assign them
4:07
confidence based on whether they are legally binding whether they have a credible plan for implementation and
4:14
whether countries are actually already on a downward path reducing their emissions towards net zero and if we
4:21
only take those targets into account and you can see that uh even with those long-term targets we are still far from
4:27
limiting warming to two degrees that would be the case be here on this figure with warming by the end of the century
4:33
Beyond two degrees and continuing there after so let us be clear from the start we are
4:41
not on track the climate ambition climate and Mission reductions need to be strengthened uh
4:49
urgently so it is clear that on the current pledges uh we are heading towards
4:56
exceeding the limits that we have set in the Paris agreement but scientifically there will be a very long period of gray
5:03
before science will have high confidence that 1.5 will or has been crossed and
5:10
there are two dimensions of this gray space the first is um to actually know the exact global warming and that you
5:17
can see here on the left hand side that is a um a screenshot from a uh from the
5:23
from a the climate change tracker website where also members of the
5:29
provide Consortium provided input to where you can see at the bottom you can
5:34
see the global temperatures and also the human induced share of that now you can
5:39
see that the best estimate is currently at one and a quarter degrees 1.26 but your
5:46
uncertainties around that that estimate are 1 1.6 so in a way today we could
5:52
already be have have committed more than 1.5 degrees of warming which we could
5:57
also be well underneath it that uncertainty won't be reduced in the future on the right hand side you can
6:04
then see in an illustration of the uncertainty going forward and that uncertainty is twofold first of all with
6:11
how many emissions we are going to emit will be will we reduce emissions strongly or will we continue to increase
6:17
them and how the climate responds to those emissions and actually and the
6:24
combination of those two uncertainty means that there will be a long period of gray before uh we will have high
6:31
confidence that 1.5 has been crossed and that really means that there is
6:37
um there is no clear cutoff time when we can say in an easy and straightforward
6:43
way that we have reach 1.5 and that we are now clearly
6:48
Beyond it finally stopped being on track has a few
6:55
implications um first of all I want to highlight uh
7:00
and and one of those is that one is considering overshoot Pathways overshoot pathways are Pathways that uh first fail
7:08
to limit warming below a certain temperature threshold and then afterwards trying to catch up
7:15
and in those Pathways we use carbon dioxide removal to uh as part of the
7:21
mitigation uh portfolio now carbon dioxide removal can per can can perform
7:27
three main uh main tasks in large large-scale
7:33
mitigation portfolios the first task is to accelerate net reductions in the near
7:38
term in combination with very stringent reductions in emissions and that would
7:44
help us limit the maximum warming to as low levels as possible
7:49
then carbon dioxide removal also helps us with achieving Net Zero which is uh
7:55
which which is necessary to to stop warming from further increasing and
8:00
finally if if carbon dioxide removals this further scaled up we can also achieve net negative CO2 emissions and
8:07
that will lead to a slow reversal of global warming
8:13
now while we know the general um the general understanding and the General Physics of what I have just
8:19
described there's quite a bit of overconfidence when we apply that in the context of an overshoot and that
8:25
overconfidence is in two Dimensions first I see an overconfidence in the
8:31
technologies that are required to achieve an overshoot for an overshoot we
8:36
need to achieve net negative CO2 emissions that means that at some point we are betting that we will be removing
8:43
more CO2 from the atmosphere than we are still emitting into it that requires two things one that we are
8:49
effective in scaling up Technologies and two that carbon dioxide removal measures
8:56
um actually deliver the removal that we think uh that we are currently planning
9:02
for and particularly with nature-based Solutions or land-based solutions that might not be the case so this is these
9:08
are two dimensions of technological overconfidence in how we will be achieving a overshoot
9:16
the second dimension is a geophysical one um very often when we look at
9:22
overshoot Pathways we just consider the median uh the median behavior of what we
9:28
know is physically possible uh if we look at geophysical uncertainties we know that overshoot can be much higher
9:35
than we are currently planning for and we also know that uh the reversal or the reduction in temperature after an
9:42
overshoot can be much harder than just the median average
9:47
behavior that we are currently planning for so that is why I would think it is a
9:53
much more cautious uh approach to not think about overshoot which is to
9:59
aim which is basically considering aiming to fail and then hoping for the
10:04
best but rather to think about uh these Pathways or mitigation in terms of a
10:10
peak and decline where we first focus on minimizing the damages by keeping Peak warming as low as we possibly can and
10:18
then afterwards considering returning to safer safer postures by achieving the
10:24
sustainable levels of net negative CO2 emissions that we can achieve I mean that I would like to hand over to have
10:31
been a Foos who will be speaking more on the carbon dioxide removal aspects
10:37
yeah thanks very much Yuri for setting uh the scene here in a very excellent way
10:43
um as Yuri was just saying I will dive a little bit more deeply into the role of carbon dioxide removal and brought this
10:51
uh stylized pathway that I borrowed from the state of CDR report where you again
10:56
see the net CO2 and net ghg emissions that you've already seen in the last slide that Yuri presented and I wanted
11:04
to draw your attention to two things mainly and that is that as Yuri was
11:10
saying um CDR is used especially in second half of
11:15
the century to offset um also actually not only the fossil CO2 emissions that are to a minimum still
11:22
available but to a large extent also the non-co2 greenhouse gas emissions that you see here in pink currently we're
11:30
mostly looking at land um based removals but then as time progresses there's also
11:38
a phase in of the more novel CDR methods that would then typically also involve geological storage now
11:46
um as you've also seen in in US presentation already the scenario space
11:52
is wide and we could easily end up having to remove
11:58
CO2 at the in the order of of double-digit gigaton
12:04
level so um talking something like 10 between 10
12:09
and 20 gigatons CO2 in the in the second half of of the
12:15
century so this is of course a lot so let's have a look at the potentials so
12:22
in the in the state of CDR report we also had a look at what recent
12:28
assessments tell us about the potentials of the different methods to withdraw CO2
12:33
from the atmosphere and if you look at the upper side the technical potential so you actually see quite decent
12:39
potentials you may actually get the impression here that we could actually do that to to remove these massive
12:47
amounts of of CO2 with maybe a set of different CDR methods
12:53
um however we also actually look have to look at the sustainability of this and also the
13:00
roll out of a different carbon dioxide removal methods will have its own
13:06
impacts so um in the provide project we we had a look at the impacts of CDR
13:12
deployment and they depend of course a lot on the scale if you want to do everything with one technology
13:18
um then all of them actually reach their limits at some point in time so for instance if you look at the right hand
13:25
side on the top you see afforestation so plants trees that would absorb CO2 via
13:31
photosynthesis but if you wanted to do everything with afforestation you would need a lot of land to always plant these
13:37
additional trees that might actually be at odds with other sustainability goals like preserving
13:43
um certain areas of land for biodiversity might have water
13:48
constraints and impact on yields it will change our Landscapes and can actually
13:54
depending on which attitudes we're looking at also have changes to the to
13:59
the Albedo that may then offset any gains in temperature and decrease
14:04
some impacts are also dependent on how other sectors develop if you look at the
14:11
bottom you see direct air capture direct air capture of course only makes sense
14:16
if we have decarbonize the energy sector quickly enough because you need a lot of carbon free energy for the carbon
14:23
balance to work out there so um some impacts are also cross-cutting the
14:29
policy response for instance there's a worry for instance and that
14:36
allowing cheap offsets that are land-based could undermine more
14:42
expensive mitigation options in the energy sector there's a worry about
14:47
efficacy threats right if you remove a lot of CO2 from the atmosphere what does that do with things do you have ocean
14:54
out guessing these kind of things and um Yuri was already pointing also to the
15:01
uncertainties around land-based emissions because here we also have to Grapple with the effects of ongoing
15:07
climate change we've seen increasingly how disturbances can quickly lead to a reversal if a forests burn for instance
15:15
if bark beetles lead to to Forest dieback or also
15:23
droughts um and that's of course also there are also issues around acceptance so we've
15:29
screened the the literature systematically unexpected impacts of CDR deployment and what we find is that
15:35
often you do have increasingly knowledge on what it means to scale all of these
15:41
Technologies however often these studies are focused on fuel removal Technologies
15:47
and also on few impacts so we often see a uh that afforestation bioenergy
15:54
combined with Cam capture and storage and direct aircon capture and storage um are covered uh better than others and
16:03
also that environmentally side effects like water consumption impact on air quality or biodiversity due to land use
16:10
change also have more information that doesn't mean that there is not also impacts from those
16:18
other Technologies I've been showing you before but it means that um that there's
16:23
also still a lot of research to be be done in order to compose the optimal CDR portfolio now if you look back at the
16:30
potentials what I'm showing you here now is the lower end of the potential ranges that you currently find in the
16:36
literature and this is actually just a fraction of what you've previously seen
16:42
on the upper end and that's because a lot of those studies take those sustainability constraints into account
16:48
environmentally socially and so on and that means that actually our CDR
16:53
potential that's sustainable may be limited so if our potential is scarce what do we actually want to prioritize
17:02
and what you see here is a recent paper that also came forth from the project
17:09
and you see a very strong correlation between gross CO2 emissions at Net Zero
17:14
and and the CDR deployment in the middle of the century so if CDR potentials are
17:22
limited by sustainability constraints then reducing gross emissions as much as possible is really key to leave
17:27
sufficient potential for the temperature decline that Yuri was um so um evidently making a case for
17:34
earlier on in addition of course it's wise to rely on a portfolio of CDR
17:40
options that further reduce the risks to sustainability but at the same time ensure that we have sufficient potential
17:47
to tap into for this temperature Decline and what I've already told you before is that we need negative CO2 emissions to
17:54
also achieve and sustain that zero DHT emissions in the long run so I want to
17:59
close with a with an illustration of why we actually think um this this long-term temperature
18:05
decline is so important and it's important to prioritize our CDR
18:10
potentials for that and what you see here is that a study where um one of the
18:18
the results is very evidently that 50 years of overshoot above 1.5 degrees can
18:26
already commit around 20 centimeters of additional sea level rise by 2 300.
18:32
that's a median estimate obviously but that's a lot so by focusing on Nets or
18:38
by prioritizing Net Zero ghdp can decline and long-term Global immune surface
18:44
temperature to trajectory instead of stabilization or what we previously called Net Zero CO2 you can reduce the
18:51
2300 sea level rise by almost half a meter and that's a lot and that's
18:56
actually I said it it's just one example but ongoing work on other aspects like
19:01
permafrost males and peatlands show similar results so um with that example
19:07
I want to give over to Ben to tell us more on the SRM part
19:13
thanks Savina so um as Yuri and Sabine have shown already um there is uh we're both very close to
19:21
the 1.5 degree threshold and um uh there's a lot of uncertainty in our
19:28
potential deployments of carbon dioxide removal and uh in the context of of this there's
19:35
increasing debate about uh about another uh proposed feature in in in in in in
19:44
overshoots of solar radiation modification and so when we say this um
19:51
um we mean uh artificial temporary modification of of the Albedo the
19:58
reflectiveness of the planet um and uh there's a there's been a number of proposed idealized ways of
20:05
doing this in literature um but in the context of today we're talking about uh injection of sulfates
20:13
into the stratosphere from thousands of aircraft every single day or the right
20:18
the brightening of marine clouds by the injection of particles um over the ocean into the atmosphere
20:26
um and so this um needless to say is a highly
20:32
controversial proposal um fundamentally SRM is not like CDR so
20:38
CDR you are removing the root cause if you can pull it off you're removing the root cause of the problem by removing
20:44
carbon dioxide from the atmosphere SRM is not doing that so solar radiation management is is masking the uh the the
20:53
temporarily the the impacts or some of the impacts of climate change um but the the concentrations of
21:01
greenhouse gases and the atmosphere remain first order unchanged and so when we talk about SRM it's not
21:07
really canceling out climate change it it depends on the impact so um if if Humanity uh uh carried this out
21:16
in the in uh in the long term there are some problems which might be masked like exposure to extreme heat
21:22
um but it wouldn't reverse the exact pattern of climate change and so SRM is
21:28
more efficient at cooling lower latitude areas and higher latitude areas so uh
21:33
and so getting that balance you can't you can't restore the temperature change that you had in the pre-industrial state
21:39
and there's some problems it doesn't address at all like ocean acidification which is a function of the carbon
21:44
dioxide concentrations uh and not of their radiative effect and for precipitation
21:51
um what what we see is that that SRM plus uh the background climate change
22:00
um significantly multi modifies the precipitation patterns which we see so
22:06
um it's not that we're getting rid of climate change it's that we're creating an alternative climate change and what's
22:12
more that the uh that combined effect of the two of the two forces of the of the
22:19
of the s3m plus the carbon dioxide um is is doubly uncertain in terms of
22:25
getting model consensus in what the outcome could be and so if if we then imagine fast
22:32
forwarding to a period where this was attempted um and uh and and there would be
22:40
negative impacts perhaps some regions as Illustrated here perhaps the Amazon
22:45
would have um uh the decreases in net precipitation according to one model's
22:51
geoengineering studies um it's uh so therefore it's it's quite
22:57
visible that there would be uh regions which would suffer climate impacts correctly from the SRM from the climate
23:04
change and and at that point it will be quite difficult to disentangle the two
23:09
um and if at that point it was decided to Cease the SRM
23:14
um we then face a period of incredibly rapid climate change as the system
23:20
restores rapidly whether within a period of of one year or so back to the the
23:26
natural now unknown climate state so um if we'd been doing this for 50 years
23:32
continuously uh in injecting sulfates into the atmosphere while greenhouse gas
23:39
concentrations continue to accumulate uh we would no longer we would no longer know where the system would return to so
23:47
it takes the climate projection problem
23:55
framed in SRM um as in the context of ownership
24:00
Pathways and so that's why we're thinking about it in provide um uh it's it's proposed um in the
24:07
context of an overshoot where you go over your target temperature for a particular for a certain period of time
24:13
and then uh enact negative emissions to get back get you back down to that temperature
24:20
um uh the proposal is that you do a short period of SRM during this period to maintain temperatures at your target
24:27
1.5 degrees for example um the issue with this is it assumes
24:32
that you know a lot of information ahead of time about both how the system will respond to SRM and how uh and and our
24:42
capacity to perform um carbon removal from the atmosphere in the future
24:47
and so one of the questions for a study uh we get in provided last year was um what was what if we didn't have
24:54
perfect foresight what if there remains significance uncertainties which are real about how um how the system would
25:00
respond both to The Climate forcing and to the Som forcing
25:06
um and so what we found was that um if we took a an ensemble of scenarios which uh
25:13
which were following current ndcs um and then we assumed uh that uh Beyond
25:22
2100 that uh there was uh there was the capacity for long-term carbon removal
25:28
that we sampled our ability uh to be able to do that using the num the kind of numbers which Sabina just presented
25:34
to you looking at the uncertainty bounds of potential CDR um and and what we found is that the
25:41
time scales associated with a planned short-term deployment of SRM could be uh
25:48
multiple centuries could be up to over 400 years since some of the simulations in our in our Ensemble and so and this
25:56
is even using uh this is even if we take optimistic numbers for ccdr so these are
26:03
the these the these are the more optimistic numbers from the first table which Sabina presented
26:09
um if if the dice don't rule in our favor and the Earth system doesn't respond um in uh in in in in in in a in a way
26:18
which makes it easy to pull down um concentrations and temperatures
26:23
um then we end up with these multi-sentral visma multi-century commitments
26:28
um multiple lifetimes worth of commitment to uh thousands of flights
26:34
per day um maintaining temperatures at a certain levels
26:40
and so an a framing which is becoming increasingly common in the in the
26:45
ethical and scientific debate about about whether we should even be
26:51
researching SRM but here but certainly um thinking about it in the policy space
26:57
um is uh it is is a risk risk framing so so the idea is that we should be
27:02
comparing the the risks of climate change against the the risks of enacting
27:08
excellent and so what we're arguing in this project is that this this framing
27:14
is is over simplistic um because the two the two risks are not independent the world in which we carry
27:22
out solar radiation management um the underlying climate change is no
27:27
longer the same and this is both physical reasons because um SRM changes uh the not the the way
27:35
that the natural carbon cycle behaves it changes our ability to implement Technologies like uh like like uh
27:43
they're like voltage cells in for solar power and uh but also it changes uh it
27:50
changes politics um because at the moment much of our consensus about the need to mitigate
27:57
climate change is based on the idea that we uh that in order to reduce our risks
28:04
in the future we have to uh reduce we have to uh reduce our emissions of
28:09
greenhouse gases so if we break that link by allowing those risks to be uh
28:15
indefinitely masked then we don't know what the outcome of that would be and so
28:21
all these things together mean that um we can't consider the risks of SRM and
28:26
risks of climate change to be independent they're intricately coupled and involved processes uh which we can't
28:32
uh which we have no capacity yet to model um so that's uh that's all I've got to say
28:39
so I think we're passing back to Carl so it ties up thank you very much during Sabine and
28:46
Ben um for these excellent insights from the project and we're gonna hear now uh from
28:52
uh select two Reflections from kaisan Philippe and before I give the floor to
28:58
Kaiser I just want to remind our audience uh that you can use the Q a function uh to put forward questions to
29:06
our panelists all of our panelists you can either put them to the whole panel or to individual speakers some of you
29:12
are using this quite actively that is fantastic and after the two inputs from calcium flip we will turn to those
29:18
questions and enter the Q a session thank you guys
29:25
thank you Carl uh presenters and thank you provide for the invitation in light of all the devastation we're
29:31
already witnessing with current warming uh it's clear that we need to do everything to stop this madness to look
29:37
at all the options we have but once you've done that scanning with all the options the picture is very
29:43
clear the clearest and safest path to avoid and leave it overshoot and prevent irreversible impacts is a rapid fossil
29:50
fuel phase out ask the ipcc AR success the higher the 2030 emissions the higher they overshoot
29:57
so right now we've got to focus on this decade um with the tools that we already have
30:04
and that are proven to work according to the ipcc we can have Global emissions by 2030 with the biggest potential seen in
30:10
fossil and wind electrification efficiency throughout and sustainable Food Systems and ecosystems protection
30:16
and restoration CCs is hardly in the picture for this critical decade the ipcc's potential for about one gigaton
30:23
by 2030 with high costs but the actual delivery will be much less as we all know CC has CCS has a long history of
30:32
repeated failures and unmet expectations despite having been on the oil Majors
30:37
agenda for decades and enjoying government subsidies by but solar and wind then again continue exceeding
30:44
expectations their exponential exponential growth will continue for the rest of this decade and solar while
30:50
already being the cheapest energy source in history will half in price again by 2030 and together they can grow even
30:57
faster than expected right now if we allow them to but will that be enough no if you don't
31:03
at the same time push for cell fuels out of the way and definitely not if we don't push them because we keep on
31:09
hoping something else will come instead technofix says that some argue would allow us to suck carbon back from the
31:15
atmosphere in very large quantities or to reflect some of the sun's Rays back
31:21
into the space but any researcher that has sung any reality checked checked on
31:26
this field knows that what works in models and on paper may not work in the real world on a large scale and without
31:33
uncontrollable collateral damage instead we may end up creating a much bigger
31:38
mess due to issues related to permanence biodiversity and competing demands for
31:43
land and water and blue water we have no guarantees that industrial removals can actually be implemented on
31:49
a large scale so we definitely shouldn't count on it so again let's focus on avoiding and limiting overshoot in the
31:56
first place and then on removals yes we will need them by now but let's prioritize what we
32:01
already have what works and what brings other benefits to reversing deforestation sustainable reforestation
32:08
managing soils to increase carbon levels and protecting wetlands and to allow them to recover and flourish Remain the
32:14
most effect most cost effective and currently viable approaches to CDR relevant to both developed and to
32:21
developing countries can we do with objects DAC and large scale industrial plantations well some
32:28
Pathways do still exist in the ipcc literature that do without picks or that's substantially limit the need for
32:35
large-scale removals and in fact these are the pathways associated with highest co-benefits and lowest risks and yes
32:41
they entail very rapid reduction since fossil fuel production and use which is probably why there has been less
32:48
attention to them in some circles how about solar radiation modification then does it need to be an option on the
32:54
table no because it just isn't an option it doesn't qualify as an option because it's simply ineffective unrealistic and
33:01
too risky as Benjamin brainly brilliantly sums up masking some problems creating others so
33:08
I Echo those hundreds of scientists who call for an international non-use agreement on solar geoengineering it's a
33:15
big distraction from the things we know we need to do which is to get the carbon emissions to zero
33:20
so we know what to do and we have the money but the money is heading the wrong way now last year many fossa few
33:26
companies made record profits but now they are scaling back on their climate Ambitions nearly all of their
33:32
Investments is still going to the continuation of the old fossil fuel fossil and gas business model
33:39
so we can't trust their Net Zero pledges and their promises on fixing things later and we can't trust them to manage
33:45
their own transitions they need to be mandated to change So to avoid getting too focused on the
33:51
speculative and risky stuff let's acknowledge that we haven't even properly started with the existing
33:56
options none of the world's largest fossil fuel producers have committed to ending new investments in oil and gas
34:03
production and are instead increasing them among developed countries only minor producers Hampstead end dates for
34:09
oil and gas production so it's not like we tried everything and it didn't work so now we need a plan B it's more like
34:15
get serious with the plan a and realistic with the Blandy so as your research said peak and decline minimize
34:23
damages and return to safer Pace to us thereafter so to sum up the best way to
34:28
avoid and limit 1.5 overshoot is to succeed with investigate implementing Solutions we already have in both image
34:35
reductions and removals and with large case CDR it's speculative risky and not
34:40
compatible with often not compatible with human rights so nothing to rely on and everything to put strict
34:47
sustainability limits for to combine back to sabina's presentation cop 28 needs to agree on a 1.5 align
34:55
fossil fuel phase out and build resilience for the impacts and loss and damages we can no longer avoid thank you
35:01
very much
35:09
thank you very much Kaiser excellent points Philippe over to you
35:16
yeah thank you very much for your invitation first I'm pleased to be with you here in the
35:24
very good audience despite being a Friday evening in in
35:30
Europe uh congratulations to the project provide and its participants for their
35:36
dynamism and also for the policy relevance of their activities with regard to the question of the day
35:43
um coming from the G research Innovation you will not be surprised that I will focus on these aspects and not touch
35:50
much on the policy uh of the EU itself
35:55
uh because this is not my direct competence but as an easy the official of course I can refer to the line of the
36:02
commission I will start by this on the two issue with regard to overshoot
36:08
there is no specific line because the EU has an objective that is known to old
36:13
and we really focus our uh policy on achieving this objective as much as
36:22
possible and all or energy is focused on that so that is very clear we don't lose
36:28
time in um uh diverting from this objective that
36:34
is not easy that is very ambitious that we are implementing um with all the energy we have with
36:41
regard to uh the uh solar radiation management and
36:47
um geoengineering techniques I would like to inform those who don't know that
36:52
there was a recent joint communication uh between the European external election service and the European
36:58
Commission on uh climate and security Nexus uh that came in 2023 and normally
37:07
if you use your best your preferred browser you would find it and it provides the position of the European
37:14
commission and the European Action Service on this issue and where
37:21
it's quite clear that we don't invest in Technologies in this area in research we
37:27
have no taboo but we have a limited budget and we have to set priorities and
37:33
we focus the research activities on the priorities that we find most relevant to
37:39
make sure that the EU reaches its climate objective
37:44
we have so we focus in the research program on
37:49
an action related to the governance of
37:55
climate interventions there is a there was a call in the work program of 2023
38:02
uh in of horizon Europe and uh the grant agreement is about to be signed and the
38:08
name of the Consortium the winning Consortium will soon be announced they will work on this through a coordination and support action looking at this issue
38:16
of governance in this area but there's also uh European research Council
38:23
project uh called Jenny g-e-n-i-e that you may also find through
38:30
your preferred browser that looks into Pathways uh in
38:37
the context of the European Union so we are investigating the issue without invest investing in Technologies and uh
38:45
to develop those because those are not amongst our priorities clearly
38:51
and uh I wish to say also here that the European commission is not related to
38:58
the activities of the climate overshoot Commission even if the head of climate overshoot
39:03
commission is pascalami former EU AC commissioner probably the name
39:08
commission was kept for uh some reason he may remember of this good period in
39:15
the European commission but we are not related to their activities their report will come out I think next week and we
39:22
are curious to read it but we did not participate to these uh activities
39:28
um and last element that I wish to you to to know is that the group of Chief
39:36
scientific advisors uh to the European commission is being consulted uh on this
39:42
area they are currently developing their thinking it's not exactly the same type
39:47
of approach as uh the climate of a shoot commission and uh
39:54
their opinion uh I don't know exactly when it will be released but it would be
39:59
one of the element uh uh taken into consideration in the wide set of views
40:06
from the scientific communities on this issue that is certainly important that needs to be investigated but I repeat is
40:13
not a current priority for the implementation of our policies and I wish to end thank uh Yuri for uh his
40:21
presentation where he in my view caught the the use the right word is that in
40:28
this area there's a lot of overconfidence technological overconfidence probably
40:33
overconfidence in the reliability of the models in this area I'm a former climate
40:39
modeler and we know that models are approximations always of the reality and
40:45
sometimes very crude approximation and modesty should also guide or the
40:50
approach of all researchers and policy makers thank you foreign
40:58
thank you very much Philippe thank you again Kaiser thanks for picking up on these points and uh I think these were
41:04
really excellently made also your last point in terms of the modesty on our Reflections that are now has changed very strongly resonated with me with me
41:11
as well um thank you to you our audience for providing us with the number of
41:16
questions that we are going forward to address now in the remaining time of this webinar feel free to also continue
41:22
to use the Q a function um the panel has already started picking
41:28
up some of your questions and then we want to start out with a question around the probabilities around ndc's carbon
41:34
budgets and temperature outcomes among different emission Pathways and then also on these submission Pathways the
41:41
role of non-co2 greenhouse gases and in particular methane I will hand over this question to Yuri and to all panelists
41:49
please feel free to also react to each other and also in particular for the members of the provide Consortium feel
41:54
also free to to react to some of the points being made by kaisan Philippe in your responses thank you
42:02
yeah thanks thanks first of all for uh to the panelists for these Reflections uh I think they they go very well with
42:10
uh with with the scientific concerns and the scientific insights that uh that we prove that we uh presented earlier
42:18
um it was asked to answer two questions the first is on Pathways and the likelihood
42:25
uh so basically the in the presentation and the study that I present we don't
42:30
use uh carbon budget as a proxy to estimate what the temperature outcome of these
42:36
pathways are but we use um simple climate models that are calibrated to represent in the most
42:44
accurate way uh the assessment of the climate response and the climate
42:52
uncertainties of the ipcc so we basically take the CO2 the methane and
42:58
and the pathway of all the greenhouse gas emissions over time and we run them through through a uh simple climate
43:05
model and in that we have the more scientifically most um reliable interpretation of what the
43:12
temperature outcome of these uh Pathways could be um the question if you are thinking
43:19
about mitigation Pathways and which likelihood to pick for limiting warming
43:25
below 2 degrees or below 1.5 um ultimately that is not the scientific questions as that is a a purely societal
43:34
um and probably even an ethical question uh what your risk aversions towards
43:39
failure is and if um the temperature limits that we are considering 1.5 or 2
43:45
are indeed limits not to exceed than a a 50 chance of still exceeding it might be
43:52
a a too high risk to run and so you would like to be taking carbon budgets
43:58
that have a a larger chance of limiting warming below these limits and therefore are significantly smaller
44:05
uh there were several questions on the role of methane or other short-lived
44:10
greenhouse gases um their role is relatively clear
44:16
um in all Pathways that limit warming to the goals of the Paris agreement be it well below 2 degrees or 1.5 methane
44:24
emissions are reduced stringently so um yes they should be considered they are
44:30
considered and in a way the important thing to remember here is reducing them
44:37
doesn't buy us time for CO2 doesn't make the picture Rosier compared to what we
44:43
have already been presenting on the contrary if we fail to reduce emissions
44:48
in of methane either in the fossil extraction or the agricultural sector we
44:54
will end up with a smaller carbon budget or with higher warming than we have current we are currently considering in
45:01
the pathways
45:08
thank you very much Yuri um thanks for providing those insights I want to turn maybe to Sabina now and
45:16
some questions about specifically in relation to CDR uh some of them we've
45:21
started responding to in writing but maybe they married also a bit of a bigger attention so the first one was a
45:27
question around the total CCS potential potential so if we talk carbon dioxide removal we also need to ask questions
45:33
about storage in particular about direct architecture and carbon capture and storage there needs to be a question and
45:39
there was a reflection around the storage potential that I think would be very useful for us to think about in
45:45
particular also in the light of wood Ben has been presenting and then lastly there was also a question put forward on
45:51
the reflect or basically on the framing of carbon dioxide was being part or being unavoidable under certain
45:58
scenarios has led to a strong response in the business sector on some of these technological solutions and whether or
46:04
not there's a bit of a misperception happening and how the panel would feel about the current situation and this
46:10
focus on this as being a part of the solution and maybe so so it is suggested potentially an over Focus compare in
46:17
compared to all the caveats that we've been discussing here today so Sabina I think we would be very interested to hearing from you about these two
46:23
questions yes I I think I actually already um responded a little bit to CDR
46:29
questions here and there in the Q a box so so please go there for more concrete information
46:35
um but it's of course true that uh specifically when you look at the large uh higher end uh estimates of the
46:42
potentials that we see for ducks for instance um the limiting factor that we're really
46:48
looking at is how much geological store storage will be available how much we
46:53
will actually be able to scale also the infrastructure that would enable us to transport the CO2 to store it safely
47:00
there to monitor it and um and that will then of course also compete uh with with
47:06
other customers because geological storage is also part for instance when you combine bio energy with current
47:12
caption storage or when we talk about um in the in the shorter term when we talk about
47:17
capturing fossil CCs in in the industry um that's not reduced quickly enough so
47:25
this is definitely a consideration and something to to take into account and
47:30
which is why then also some of those potentials at the lower end are a little
47:36
bit more conservative um and yeah so I think it's not only a
47:41
question of what's really geologically available but also how much can be made
47:46
useful in in the short time frames that we're sometimes looking at uh when
47:51
scaling um scaling these Technologies now um with respect to to Glenn's
47:56
question on uh you see a lot of business interest in CDR and the ipcc emphasizing
48:02
also that CDR is is almost indispensable right now what I think um
48:08
there's always a lot of media coverage uh when when uh companies go for a go
48:15
for cder but then if you look at the total volumes it's actually not that
48:20
much yet especially also looking at uh compared to to other activities
48:26
um but I think uh it's it's definitely something that should be on the radar of
48:32
policy makers and they're of course ways around that uh that policy makers have
48:37
influence on so um I think emissions reductions targets if they remain
48:43
untouched it's a strong signal that emissions reductions are prioritized and then if you have separately targets for
48:50
carbon dioxide removal um that also sends the strong message that you cannot exchange one for the
48:58
other and sort of like a green wash your uh your your ongoing emissions
49:03
um with uh with removals so um careful consideration needs to be given also
49:10
what you can in the end um what you can in the end offset or
49:16
what you need to prioritize with what and here science is needed to underpin also what policymakers come up with but
49:23
I think a first step into the right direction would actually be to separate the two
49:29
um the two uh yeah emissions reductions and carbon removal on the other hand so
49:35
that uh yeah that there's not the perception created that you can trade
49:41
one thing off for the other easily
49:46
thank you very much Sabina uh I'm now looking if any one of uh else of our
49:52
panelists wants to wants to share perspectives on this maybe maybe Kaiser since since we move this was also
49:58
basically going Beyond a new realm of Science and and touched on some of the reflections that you shared with us as
50:03
well uh maybe you have a perspective on this particular point to share with us too
50:09
thank you Glenn I think uh I'm also looking at the last your last question has the research Community put so much
50:15
focus on CDR overshoot Etc that the business Community now thinks the best thing they can do to
50:21
climate is to invest in CDR Ducks how to address this I think it's an excellent question
50:27
um I'm not sure I would blame the scientists kind of um in a way I had to even when I Was preparing for this panel
50:35
I had to Google when was it that the ipcc published a special report on on carbon Captain storage it was almost 20
50:41
years ago so I feel like that's when we already kind of there was this one wave of hype
50:47
uh but this despite all this discussion then how little has actually happened uh
50:53
in that world of CCN since then so I think the researcher has come after that
50:59
with the 1.5 Celestial report and then the research that followed but that put
51:04
more sort of emphasis on the sustainability limits of city of CDR and
51:09
especially of Dex and all that it is making the picture more clear at least for us we're following it more closely
51:15
and I think we're indeed like clarification is still needed is on sort of the sequencing and the time timelines
51:23
what is it that we absolutely need for what period and especially now that we have to focus on this critical decade
51:30
you know now let's put all our eggs on like minimizing the need for the the CDR
51:38
minimizing the overshoot getting those force of your um emissions down but of
51:44
course then also when we look at the rest of it the the CDR then the as realistic as possible so that we no
51:51
longer kind of pretend that something is happening at some point but nobody doing anything
51:56
that would you know suggest is actually happening so um I'm not sure whether the
52:03
answer to a question but yes I think there is still uh room and need for
52:09
specifying like Sabina said what is it that we actually need to prioritize
52:15
right now thank you very much Kaiser
52:20
um looking to to you Philippe if you also had some thoughts to share on on this particular point or anyone else from the panelists
52:27
yeah briefly I mean uh to react about the Curiosity of the researchers I think
52:33
it's just normal that researchers look at all kinds of options even some that are very fancy
52:41
um that's this part of the development of knowledge and and then they have to see the pros and the cons for everything
52:48
of course business looks at opportunities and no one should blame them for that but it's the role of
52:55
policy makers to make sure that the business opportunities also serve the
53:00
societal challenges and the priorities in the social societal challenges this is what we try to do uh and and
53:08
therefore I think we are currently operating in a safe Space by not being
53:15
blind to developments That Others May May do looking at the governance at the
53:22
possible consequences of new technologies in these areas and explore
53:27
the options of CDR that are workable and compatible with all or other
53:33
Environmental um objectives so we try to do this in a
53:38
sound way and we count on the researcher to guide us in a very balanced way in this direction
53:47
thank you very much Philippe this is this is also really really interesting to hear the reflections on on this question from from your site and also
53:53
the role of that science can play and should play and give you uh in informing uh your decision making uh I know uh
54:01
Yuri wants to have a short reflection but I already want to put another question to Yuri and then maybe Ben to
54:06
follow up on which is around uh scenarios to more explicitly uh explore
54:12
questions and scientific questions around overshoot and what should be our Focus there and and what could be and
54:19
should be done in terms of a scientific and research agenda going going forward so maybe during a short reflection and
54:24
then over to you then yeah first a short reflection on um
54:31
whether the scientific Community um kind of is is is is responsible for kind
54:38
of setting setting the wrong wrong emphasis in what with with researching and focusing on CDR to be honest I think
54:46
um every researcher is excited about what they uh what they research and if they find something new they shout about
54:52
it and then it's the media who amplifies uh selectively from what research shout
54:58
and it's not just see and it's CDR tends to be picked up a lot but there are many other things uh that that are not being
55:04
picked up unfortunately uh think think about efficiency or demand side
55:11
measures uh which which are aspects that are research a lot that we understand very well uh but but that are not really
55:18
uh picked up and I think um well it's just a question of of which which story
55:24
is most media Savvy uh and um and and unfortunately CDR uh is is is is very
55:32
desirable for for for journalists um on on the scenarios that that are
55:39
required or that we can use to understand uh near-term futures
55:44
um actually the near term is is is quite is
55:50
in terms of scenario terms relatively easy to model and that means that the the near term is to a very large degree
55:56
already determined by what we have emitted until today so even if we consider very a very high
56:04
continuation or a strong departure from current trends the next five to ten
56:10
years won't yet see a very large difference in temperature or climate projections
56:18
um these this departures from Trends is however extremely important to slowly
56:23
make the ship turn towards a lower common uh lower climate future and so
56:29
it's only uh it's not until three four five decades in the future that the real difference the absolute difference in um
56:37
in in scenarios becomes visible um but I want to hand over to Ben who
56:42
maybe can add some further Reflections on this yeah thanks Yuri um I mean I guess I'll I'll continue on
56:50
from the same thread and then and then bring it back to scenarios but in terms of the uh
56:55
the the the danger that scientists over focus on CDR I think we have to think
57:02
here that there's more than one community of scientists um and uh and and whereas uh some
57:10
economic models um may have uh may prefer CDR uh as as
57:17
an easy solution to to climate change arguably the physical modeling Community haven't engaged with this question
57:23
enough of how to put real process understanding in how that how CDR would
57:29
function in the context of of of of coupled system processes
57:35
um and this is realized and and this is in in a in a community-wide conversation
57:40
about what scenarios should look like uh in as we seek to inform the next decade
57:48
of of mitigation and the ipcc um uh there's there's a lot of questions
57:53
about what scenarios need to do um firstly uh that there's there's an
58:00
assessment of where we are now in in in terms of uh whether what strategies for
58:06
meeting the Paris targets are still on the table what do they look like
58:12
um and also can we can we frame uh questions which
58:18
are useful for informing uh near-term differences in in mitigation
58:25
ambition so uh what What's what are the consequences of of a decade delay in action uh a scenario space needs to be
58:32
able to capture this this kind of question but also in terms of uh the question referred to uh the the
58:39
potential um uh ecosystem feedbacks which we might which we might encounter if we uh if we
58:46
overshoot um the the Paris targets um and so uh part of this question is is
58:54
a reassessment of what is our upper end what is our worst case scenario
59:00
um and that's an active research question so extrapolating what current policies are
59:05
um and what the likelihood is you know in a worst case scenario that we failed to achieve some of those currency so
59:10
some of those policies where do you end up um is is for an adaptation perspective
59:16
something which we need to get a handle on um in order to properly quantify the risks
59:21
um of failing to act um in the near term and so um so part of this is about
59:28
thinking about how our models are wired together at the moment we have uh
59:34
models which we run on supercomputers of the entire Earth system and we tend to run scenarios where we are assuming a
59:41
concentration pathway um one of the challenges going towards the next phase of the ipcc is whether we
59:48
can reframe these scenarios in terms of activity in terms of um changes in in fossil fuel emissions
59:55
in terms of the implementation of different types of CDR strategies in terms of uh our strategies with land use
1:00:03
management and and if we can get these decisions into the domain of uh complex
1:00:10
process models then we can begin to put better error bars on the outcomes and
1:00:15
the risks associated with different strategies associated with CDR associated with Reliance on
1:00:21
afforestation this kind of thing um so we can definitely um build
1:00:28
um in more informative scenarios going forward and uh and that's yeah I think
1:00:33
that's broadly what the community is trying to do right now excellent thank you very much ben I have
1:00:39
uh one last point to advertise on the question of scenarios that I'm the provide we've created a set of overshoot
1:00:44
scenarios that we are systematically exploring also under until the year 2300 and we make available the results
1:00:50
available on our provides climate risk dashboard where you can explore yourself the implications of overshooting
1:00:55
different locations some of these questions are being explored there obviously by the efforts are required but we are trying to adjust in spare
1:01:02
heads points so please if you're interested in our work consider following us um
1:01:07
in the range of different platforms and maybe also our website and newsletter
1:01:13
and we will keep you very closely informed with that it's two minutes past
1:01:18
the hour on what is in Europe Friday evening and I want you to invite you all to join me with a round of applause for
1:01:25
our panelists and speakers thank you very much for your time very much appreciated In This Very enriching discussions
1:01:31
um there are lots more questions also in the chat we hope to follow up with many of you then also via email feel free to
1:01:38
also reach out to the consult some more individual speakers if you have follow-up questions and of course we will be in the position to share our
1:01:44
slides hope to lose those of you are interested um with that I bring that webinar to a close I want to thank you all for your
1:01:50
interest and hope to see you at any next event that the consultant might organize have a great afternoon and evening to
1:01:57
all of you and a very good weekend thank you
